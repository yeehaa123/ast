    <p><p>Computers are literally everywhere. Through heterogeneousinterfaces - such as sensors, transistors, and servo motors - they are inextricably linked to works of art, bodies, and spaces. As a result, it is difÔ¨Åcult to analyse cultural objects independent of their technological apparatus.</p><p>Nevertheless, scholars in the humanities are reluctant to learn about the hard-, wet-, and software of art, literature, culture, and politics. In this course we will modestly attempt to compensate for our discipline's digital illiteracy and research the following question:</p><blockquote>What kind of approaches, methods and techniques are needed to analyse the technological dimension of contemporary cultural objects?</blockquote><p>Rather than approaching this question from a purely theoretical perspective, we will learn to code ourselves. Programming, however, is only a means to an end. We will treat code as a particular form of knowledge organisation. The goal of this course is not to turn you into professional programmers, but to gain an additional tool to pursue your research.</p></p>
