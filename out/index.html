  <h1>Objectives</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction to programming and its relevance for doing research in the      humanities</li>
    <li>Overview of key concepts and texts in philosophy of technology</li>
    <li>Pursue collective research on the implications of contemporary      technological developments on academic and artistic practices.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section class="description">
  <h1>Description</h1><p>Computers are literally everywhere. Through heterogeneousinterfaces - such as sensors, transistors, and servo motors - they are inextricably linked to works of art, bodies, and spaces. As a result, it is difﬁcult to analyse cultural objects independent of their technological apparatus.</p><p>Nevertheless, scholars in the humanities are reluctant to learn about the hard-, wet-, and software of art, literature, culture, and politics. In this course we will modestly attempt to compensate for our discipline's digital illiteracy and research the following question:</p><blockquote>What kind of approaches, methods and techniques are needed to analyse the technological dimension of contemporary cultural objects?</blockquote><p>Rather than approaching this question from a purely theoretical perspective, we will learn to code ourselves. Programming, however, is only a means to an end. We will treat code as a particular form of knowledge organisation. The goal of this course is not to turn you into professional programmers, but to gain an additional tool to pursue your research.</p>

<section class="requirements">
  <h1>Requirements</h1>
  <p>My master level courses are research based. This means that I engage you in my current research projects, and that you are expected to set up your own project during the semester. As a result, the level is advanced from the start and there is little time to catch up in between. You should spend 20 hours a week on average on this course (corresponds to 12 ECTS). Make sure that you (pro-)actively participate throughout the semester.</p>
  <section class="prerequisites">
    <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
    <p>You do not need prior experience in coding to follow this course. I do expect you to do some minor preparatory work, however. Before the second session, you should have completed tutorials listed below. Anyone that fails to meet this requirement cannot participate in this course.</p>

  <section class="assessment">
    <h1>Assessment</h1><p>In order to complete this course, you have to finish at least 8 out of 10 weekly assignments. You should collect these assignments in a portfolio. This portfolio will be graded twice; thefirst time after the midterm break, the second at the end of the semester.</p> <blockquote>Final Grade = Weekly Assignments (0%) + Portfolio 1 (25%) + Portfolio 2 (75%)</blockquote><p>Weekly readings, coding exercises, and participation are also mandatory but not graded separately. Failing these requirements, however, can lead to a failing grade.</p>

    <p>A resit of this class is only possible, if you met all requirements listed above in time and your final grade is below a 5.5. The resit consists of an entirely new version of both assignment 1 and 2. The resit for the final paper takes place in July. You will have the entire month to complete your new project.</p>
