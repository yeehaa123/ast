assignment:
  description: >
    Add a form to last week's visualisation that makes it possible to add extra datapoints. Use jQuery to get the data from the form. Do this using the new event handler syntax as explained in "Beginning jQuery" rather than the old one used in "JavaScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual". Don't worry about validations yet. Store and retrieve the data with their JavaScript Client. Hint: it may help to do firebase's 5 minute tutorial.
