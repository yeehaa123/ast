  description: >
    Install node.js on your computer. Set up a basic webserver on your computer 
    that serves a basic homepage. If you get stuck have a look at: 
    https://github.com/yeehaa123/simple-skeleton. Don't simply clone the repo 
    though. It is important that you reconstruct how the pieces fit together
    yourself. Send me a link to your git repository (no more gists!)
